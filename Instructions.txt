1. Dataset Exploration: Begin by thoroughly exploring and understanding the dataset you are working with. Gain insights into its structure, variables, and any potential patterns or trends that may exist within the data.

2. Handling Missing Data: Identify and report any missing data present in the dataset. Implement suitable strategies to handle missing values, such as imputation or elimination, ensuring the integrity and quality of the data.

3. Addressing Categorical Features and Outliers: Process the categorical features within the dataset, converting them into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. Additionally, detect and handle any outliers that may affect the model's performance and make appropriate adjustments or treatments.

4. Model Building: Construct your machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset. Utilize an appropriate algorithm based on the nature of your prediction task and the available data. Train the model on the input data and evaluate its performance.

5. Assessing Accuracy with Cross-Validation: Optionally, employ cross-validation techniques to assess the expected accuracy of your model. This will help validate the model's generalization capabilities and provide more robust performance metrics.

6. Identifying Impactful Variables: Analyze the model's results and identify which variables have the most significant impact on the prediction outcomes. Report these variables, as they offer valuable insights into the factors that drive the predicted prices.

It is recommended to iterate and refine the steps mentioned above based on the performance results obtained during step 5. This iterative process will enable you to enhance the accuracy and overall effectiveness of your model.
